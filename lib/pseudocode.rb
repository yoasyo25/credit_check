#valid number 4024007136512380
# assign number to a variable
# take out the last digit in the variable
# put the variable without the last digit into an array
# the array will have index from 0 - 14. Go through the array and double the values of the numbers with an even index
# assess whether the value of each number that has been doubled is more than 9.
# For those numbers that are greater than 9, add the two digits (e.g. if 16 add 1 to 6) of those numbers and get back an array that has the sum of the two digits of the doubled numbers, the doubled numbers that are less than 9, and the non-doubled numbers.
# push back the last digit of the original number to the end of the array.
# add up all the numbers in the array
# if the modulo 10 of the summed digits in the array is equal to 0, print "number is valid", else print "number is invalid"
